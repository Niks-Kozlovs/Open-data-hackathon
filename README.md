# Open data hackathon 2019
This was the first hackathon I attended. The goal of the project was to use open data to show all the educational institutions (kindergartens, schools and universities) on a map. This way, the user had an easier time to find the institution nearby and see a bit of information about it. The hackathon was for new programmers, so it was ideal for me and my team.
## What I learned
This was the first team project me and my team members worked on, so one of the things I learned was how to work like a team. We split who did what. One of us was working on the database, I was working on the map functionality. Getting the info from the database and showing it on the map, as well as filtering the data.
The most important thing I learned to use was OpenStreetMap with leaflet. This knowledge helped in further hackathons.
